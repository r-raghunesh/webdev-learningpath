**webdev-learningpath**

Welcome to webdev-learningpathâ€”my personal coding vault while learning web development! This repo is just for me, so itâ€™s packed with files, notes, and playful diagrams to keep the journey visual and fun.

ðŸš€ About This Repo
Here, I organize all the code files, projects, and micro-experiments for:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Front-End Frameworks

Back-End basics

Micro-projects and challenges

Every file is a learning step, and the folders help me retrace how far Iâ€™ve come.
